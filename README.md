# dailyJson
stripped down version of the dortania build config.plist that OC-tool can read

OC-tool is written for the bourne shell so it should run anywhere  
but this causes certain limitations, such as no arrays and no easy way to  
read a json file on every system, so json files are converted to a  
format that OC-tool can use
